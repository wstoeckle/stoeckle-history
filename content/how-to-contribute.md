# How to Contribute

## Send stories, photos, or documents
- Email or share a folder with scanned documents, photos, letters, or stories.
- Include any known dates, names, and places in a short note.

## File naming convention
Use clear, consistent names so files are easy to find:
- `lastname-firstname-documenttype-year.ext`
- Example: `seehafer-ida-death-cert-1948.jpg`

## Add a new person/place/source page
1) Copy the relevant template from `content/people/_template.md`, `content/places/_template.md`, or `content/sources/_template.md`.
2) Fill in only what you can confirm from sources.
3) Add TODOs for missing information.

## Documents that help most
- Death certificates
- Obituaries
- Probate files
- Census records
- Church registers

If you are unsure, send the document anyway. We can sort and cite it later.
