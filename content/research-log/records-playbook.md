# Records & Requests Playbook

## Michigan death certificates
- You can request from the county clerk (county where the death occurred) or from the state.
- Provide full name, date of death, place of death, and parents/spouse if known.
- TODO: Add current county and state request links and fees.

## Probate packets (Washtenaw / Jackson)
- Ask the probate court for the full estate file or probate packet, including petitions, inventories, and final orders.
- Provide the decedent's full name, approximate death date, and county.
- TODO: Add the contact details for Washtenaw and Jackson probate courts.

## Census images for hospitals
- Use FamilySearch image browsing if names are not indexed.
- Look for enumeration district (ED) maps tied to the hospital.
- TODO: Add the specific EDs for Pontiac State Hospital and Ypsilanti State Hospital once confirmed.
