# Start Here

## What this site is
This is a shared family history notebook for the Seehafer and Stoeckle families. It keeps facts, sources, and open questions in one place so research stays organized and transparent.

> If you only read one thing, start with [Facts to Date](research-log/facts-to-date.md).

## How to navigate
- People: individual profiles and confirmed life details.
- Places: addresses, towns, and institutions tied to the family.
- Sources: primary documents and citations.
- Research Log: open questions, requests, and progress notes.

## Confirmed vs Unconfirmed
- Confirmed facts are supported by sources listed on the page.
- Unconfirmed items are marked clearly and kept in TODOs or open questions until evidence is added.

## Privacy note
Please avoid sharing sensitive information about living people in public.
