# Family Announcement

Hi everyone,

We put together a private family history site for the Seehafer and Stoeckle families. It gathers people, places, and source documents in one place so it is easy to read and easy to add to over time.

Start here:
- [Start Here](start-here.md)
- [How to Contribute](how-to-contribute.md)

If you have photos, stories, letters, or documents, please share them. Even small details help. We will label sources clearly so we can keep confirmed facts separate from open questions.

Thank you for helping us preserve the family history.
